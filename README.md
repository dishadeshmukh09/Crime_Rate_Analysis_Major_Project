 ##Crime Rate Analysis Dashboard
 
#Project Overview

Domain: Public Safety & Governance

This project analyzes and visualizes crime data across Indian states and districts to uncover patterns, trends, and hotspot regions. The aim is to support data-informed decision making for governance and public safety planning.

#Project Storyline

We begin with raw crime data and apply cleaning, standardization, and modeling to prepare the dataset. The cleaned data is used to derive key crime metrics like crime rate percentage, population per crime, top crime types, and hotspots. These insights are presented using Power BI dashboards for interactive visualization.

#Key Metrics

-Crime Rate %

-Population per Crime

-Top Crime Types

-Year-on-Year Crime Trends
